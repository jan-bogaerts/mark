# MarkdownCode > services > line parser
{"LineParser": "The 'LineParser' service is a class that provides functionality for parsing markdown lines and updating links in a project's data-list items. It includes a 'Parse' function that accepts a string and line index as input, trims and converts the line to lowercase, and performs various operations based on the line type (header or regular line). For headers, it updates or creates a new text-fragment object at the index, updates line-fragments below with the new text-fragment as the parent, determines the level of the text-fragment based on the count of '#' symbols, and finds the first higher text-fragment above as the parent. For regular lines, it stores them as line-objects, updating or creating a new line-object at the index and using the first higher text-fragment as the parent if available."}
# MarkdownCode > services > position-tracking service
{"PositionTrackingService": "The PositionTrackingService is a service class that tracks a user's text-fragment, keeps track of the selected line number, related text-fragment, and event monitoring. It provides methods to set the selected line and trigger events for changes in the text-fragment."}
# MarkdownCode > services > gpt service
{"GptService": "The 'GptService' class is responsible for communication with the OpenAI API backend. It uses the OpenAI Node.js library to send API requests and retrieve available models. The class also manages a list of available services, allowing them to register and unregister. Registered services should provide a name and a 'get-result' function."}
# MarkdownCode > services > result-cache service
{"ResultCacheService": "The 'ResultCacheService' is a service class that manages cached results for other services. It uses a dictionary to map keys to results and allows services to cache their results. The cache updates the dictionary when a result is calculated and tracks relationships between text fragment titles and dictionary entries. Results are stored in a JSON file with a date for validity verification. The cache loads the JSON file during construction and registers event handlers with input objects used by the parent service. When triggered, the cache marks entries as out of date in the dictionary and notifies other cache services."}
# MarkdownCode > services > build service
{"BuildService": "The 'BuildService' is a service class that uses gpt-services to convert markdown project data into source code. It can generate conversions on multiple text frames and transform the original markdown code into source code files. Additionally, it utilizes a compress service to render results for each text-fragment in the project."}
# MarkdownCode > services > compress service
{"CompressService": "The 'CompressService' is a service that uses the GPT service to shorten a text fragment. It provides a 'get-result' function that calls the GPT service with specific parameters and utilizes a result-cache-service to store and track results. The service is useful for checking if the GPT service understands the fragment and can be used for other processes.", "ResultCacheService": "The ResultCacheService is a service that stores and tracks results obtained from the GPT service. It is used to check if the GPT service understands a text fragment and can be utilized for other processes."}
# MarkdownCode > services > dialog service
