# MarkdownCode > services > line parser
{"LineParser": "The LineParser service is a global singleton object that parses markdown lines and updates text-fragments in the project-service. It maintains an array called fragmentsIndex and creates new text-fragments based on input lines, calculating their depth-level and key. It also has a function to calculate the key of a text-fragment and handles different types of lines in the parse function.", "lineParserHelpers": "The 'lineParserHelpers' service is a global singleton object that parses markdown lines and updates text-fragments in the project-service.

# MarkdownCode > services > result-cache service
{"ResultCacheService": "The ResultCacheService is a service class that manages cached results for transformers. It allows transformers to store and track the validity of their results for each text fragment. The cache can monitor changes in both project and result fragments, and transformers use this class to cache their results using a dictionary. The cache also updates a secondary dictionary to track relationships between text fragment titles and dictionary entries. Results are stored in a JSON file specified by the transformer. Event handlers are registered to monitor changes in text fragments and input objects, and when triggered, the cache marks entries in the secondary dictionary as out of date. The cache provides functions to overwrite and retrieve results for a key, as well as determine if a text fragment is out of date. Additionally, there is a function available to retrieve all results related to a specific fragment."}
# MarkdownCode > services > project service
{"ProjectService": "The 'ProjectService' class is responsible for creating, opening, saving, updating, and managing projects. It handles various tasks such as clearing data, managing folders, caching, and raising events during project creation. It also handles tasks like setting location, reading file contents, reloading data, and raising events during project opening. Additionally, it handles tasks like moving/copying files, writing data, resetting indicators, and saving filenames during project saving. The class also manages data lists, provides functions for outline and drop-down boxes, and tracks user configurations such as auto-save settings."}
# MarkdownCode > services > gpt service
{"GPTService": "The 'GPTService' is a service class that acts as a global singleton for interacting with the open-ai API backend. It provides functions for making API requests, including sending a list of JSON objects called 'messages' to the backend using the 'createChatCompletion' function. The service also handles retries in case of request failures and offers a method to retrieve the available models list."}
# MarkdownCode > services > build service
{"BuildService": "The BuildService is a service class that converts markdown project data into source code using transformers. It performs actions for each text fragment in the project's data list by requesting transformers to render their results asynchronously."}

{"CybertronService": "The 'CybertronService' is a service class that globally manages transformers. It maintains a sub-list of entry-points for building text-fragments. Transformers can register and be added as entry-points, and they can also unregister and be removed from the available transformers and entry-points list."}
# MarkdownCode > services > transformer-base service
{"TransformerBaseService": "The 'TransformerBaseService' is a base class for transformers that provides a common interface and functionality. It handles the construction of transformers and their dependencies, utilizes a result cache service for storing and tracking results, and uses the GPT service to generate messages based on transformer-specific parameters."}
# MarkdownCode > services > compress service
{"CompressService": "The 'CompressService' is a service class that shortens text fragments and can be used for testing and other processes. It is a subclass of the transformer-base service and has a constructor that takes name and dependencies as parameters. The service instance is created and registered during startup. The build-message function takes a text fragment as input and returns a JSON array called result with system and user roles, as well as the text fragment key."}
